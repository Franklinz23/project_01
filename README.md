# Make It Happen (project_01)

*The goal of this web app is for a class leader (teacher, coach, instructor, etc) to be able to post a form specifying materials/supplies needed for a fun class project. Sometimes the school cant supply the funds, and thats where the donors come in. A donor will be able to supply what they can, to help students learn and grow. *
